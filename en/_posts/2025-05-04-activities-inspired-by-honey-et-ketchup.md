# 5 Fun Activities Inspired by "Honey et Ketchup"

Jonathan Bécotte's beautiful children's book "Honey et Ketchup" doesn't just tell a heartwarming story — it also provides an excellent starting point for activities that can help children explore themes of language, communication, and friendship. Here are five engaging activities inspired by the book that parents and educators can use to extend the learning experience.

## 1. Create a Mini Language Dictionary

### What You'll Need:
- Small notebook or stapled papers
- Colored pencils or markers
- Access to simple words in different languages

### Activity:
Have your child create a mini "language bridge" dictionary with important words they might need when making new friends. Choose 10-15 simple words like "hello," "play," "friend," "share," and "thank you" in both languages featured in the book (French and English) or any language your child is interested in learning.

For each word, create a page with:
- The word in both languages
- A simple drawing representing the word
- A sentence showing how to use it

This activity helps children understand that learning even a few words in another language can open doors to friendship.

## 2. Non-Verbal Communication Game

### What You'll Need:
- Simple action cards or ideas (written or drawn)
- Timer

### Activity:
This charades-style game helps children understand that we can communicate without words. Take turns drawing a card with an action or feeling and trying to communicate it without speaking. The other players guess what's being communicated.

Examples include:
- I'm hungry
- I want to play outside
- I'm feeling sad
- This is my favorite toy
- Let's be friends

Discuss afterwards how we can understand each other even when we don't share the same language.

## 3. Cultural Food Tasting

### What You'll Need:
- Foods from different cultures (can be simple items from the grocery store)
- Small plates and utensils
- Paper for recording reactions

### Activity:
Inspired by the title "Honey et Ketchup," create a tasting experience with food items from different cultures. This could include honey and ketchup, but also items like:
- French foods (croissant, cheese)
- Australian foods (Vegemite, Tim Tams)
- Other culture's condiments and snacks

Have children draw faces showing how they felt about each food and discuss how trying new things from other cultures can be both challenging and rewarding - just like making friends across language barriers!

## 4. "Same but Different" Collage

### What You'll Need:
- Magazines or printed images
- Glue and scissors
- Poster board divided in half

### Activity:
Help children create a collage showing things that are the same and different between two cultures or languages. Label one side "Same" and one side "Different."

For example, children in both cultures might play, eat, learn, and have families (same), but they might eat different foods, play different games, or speak different languages (different).

This activity helps children see that despite our differences, we share many commonalities.

## 5. Pen Pal Project

### What You'll Need:
- Paper and envelopes
- Art supplies
- Assistance with finding a pen pal (through schools, online programs, or family connections)

### Activity:
Help your child connect with a child from another country or who speaks another language through a pen pal program. They can exchange letters, drawings, and photos to learn about each other's lives.

For younger children not yet writing, they can draw pictures and dictate messages for parents to write. This real-world connection brings the themes of the book to life!

## Bringing the Book to Life

These activities extend the valuable lessons from "Honey et Ketchup" by giving children hands-on experiences with cross-cultural communication. By engaging with these themes through play and creativity, children can develop empathy, curiosity, and confidence in building relationships across language barriers.
